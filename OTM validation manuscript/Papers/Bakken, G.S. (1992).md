Overview:

- Operative and standard [[operative temperatures]] are thermal indices that allow single-number representations of the [[complex thermal environment]]. They can be measured directly using various physical models of the animal of interest. These models explore the thermal environment at the same [[spatial scale]] that the animal experiences, and can be replicated relatively easily to measure conditions at multiple sites.
- Discusses their relative merits for various classes of animals and types of studies. 
- Reviewes typical applications. The most important is in [[mapping]] the nanoclimate experienced by small animals and in defining [[indices]] of [[thermal quality]] of home ranges based on such maps. Others include use as [[null model]]s in physiological studies, and use as single-number descriptors of complex thermal environments in behavioral, physiological, and energetics studies.
- Artistic techniques, including sculpture and life casts, have been used to construct model animals for Te thermometers. Rather than using the skin of the animal, these sensors are painted to match the solar spectral absorptance of the animal. A very successful and esthetically-pleasing technique has been to cool reptiles to immobilize them and then make a non-toxic dental alginate life mold.
- Time response - The time response desired depends on the study. Generally, one will need very rapid time response in behavioral studies, as peripheral thermoreception allows most animals to respond behaviorally long before body core temperature changes appreciably. Exponential smoothing of instantaneous Te values can be used to obtain Tb estimates. Hollow mounts or models allow the most rapid response. In some cases, it may be desirable to use objects with significant heat storage capacity, e.g., to average temperature when recording Te at infrequent intervals (ca. 10+ min). It is important to distribute heat internally.
- It is important to test whatever object is used as a Te thermometer for accuracy and internal temperature gradients over the full range of natural conditions.
- [[Bakken and Gates, 1975]] proposed Te thermometers as a thermal mapping tool.
- Applications: nanoclimate structure, testing computational models, nanoclimate structure and position effects, thermal mapping, thermal value of the home range, null models for thermal anatomy and effectors and condensed microclimate parameters.
