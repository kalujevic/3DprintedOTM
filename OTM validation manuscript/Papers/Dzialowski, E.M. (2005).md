Overview:

- Review that focuses on the accuracy and use of [[Te]] and Tes models in ecological and physiological studies.
- The utility of [[Te]] and Tes models lie in the fact that they take a multivariate problem involving inputs of air temperature, ground temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed and map them into a single thermal metric on a [[spatial scale]] appropriate for the animal.
- integrating convective and radiative [[heat transfer]] between the environment and the animal
- The most reliable [[Te]] models are [[copper]] casts that mimic the morphology and absorptivity of an animal. 
- Simplified [[Te models]] such as [[cylinders]] and [[spheres]] have been shown to produce [[errors]] in Te as large as 12 C under certain conditions and should only be used after careful [[calibration]] against a [[live animal]].
- When calibrated and used under conditions of low solar radiation, heated taxidermic mounts and simplified Tes models produce errors in net heat production on the order of 5% or less.
- In order to provide reliable data, all types of models must be [[calibrated]] over an [[ecologically realistic range]] of environmental conditions experienced by the animal. 
- 61% of the of studies examined failed to properly calibrate the models prior to use.
- When calculating Te mathemattically, wind speed, solar radiation, Ta, and thermal radiation must be measured in the available [[microhabitat]]s.
-  Operative temperature models are typically made of copper, due to the high heat conductance of this [[metal]]. The most sophisticated Te models use an [[electroplating]] technique described by [[Bakken and Gates (1975)]] to produce a thin copper cast with a convection coefficient and morphological char- acteristics equal to that of the animal. This cast is then painted to match the animal’s [[absorptivity]] ([[Grant and Dunham, 1988]]). 
- To simplify the construction of Te models, many studies have used short pieces of [[copper]] pipe painted to match the absorptivity of the animal ([[Peterson, 1987]]; [[Huey et al., 1989]]) or small temperature loggers to measure Te in place of copper models ([[Sartorius et al., 1999]]; [[Vitt and Sartorius, 1999]]).
- Summary of model types in Table 1: [[copper]] cast models, hollowed shell, hollow [[copper]] [[cylinders]], tygon tubing, thick-walled aluminium models, tidbit or hobo loggers, copper ball, [[water]]-filled copper-moodel, carcass, mathematical equations, [[agar]] models and unheated taxidermic mount.
- The ecological utility of physical Te models depends on their ability to reliably estimate an animal’s Te in a given microclimate.
- Very few studies have examined the [[accuracy]] with which they measure [[equilibrium]] Tb of a live animal.
- [[Walsberg and Wolf., 1996]] measured the equilibrium temperature of live Sceloporus magister, copper casts of S. magister, copper cylinders, and plastic cylinders in a closed-circuit wind tunnel under one solar radiation level and a number of wind speeds. The copper casts were the most accurate predictors of the live animals equilibrium Tb. However, under the testing conditions, copper casts consistently underestimated the live lizard’s Tb by 1.8–2.5 1C, depending on wind speed.
-  [[Bakken and Gates (1975)]] reported smaller deviations of 0.25 C between the equilibrium Tb of live Sceloperous occidentalis and Te of a copper cast of S. occidentalis tested in the field.
- Most of the studies testing copper cast accuracy suggest that these models predict operative temperature to within 1 C. However, under certain conditions (i.e. low wind speed or high solar radiation) the models become less accurate.
- The absorptivity of Te models has large effects on equilibrium temperature under high solar radiation conditions and should match as closely as possible the absorptivity of the animal.
- Size influences convective and radiative heat exchange of a model and thus the equilibrium temperature of Te models. Difficulties arise when determining the Te of larger reptiles due to the potentially large thermal inertia of the models.

Definitions:

- Operative temperature (Te) is the ‘‘[[temperature]] of an inanimate object of zero heat capacity with the same size, shape, and radiative properties as the animal exposed to the same environment’’,  i.e. the body temperature of an animal if it were in thermal equilibrium with the environment in the absence of metabolic heating or evaporative cooling. ([[Bakken and Gates, 1975]]).
- Operative temperature is measured with physical models placed in the environment or with [[mathematical equations]] describing the steady-state heat transfer between the animal and the environment. 


Questions:

- What is the difference between operative temp models and standard oprative models?
- What are heated taxidermic mounts?
