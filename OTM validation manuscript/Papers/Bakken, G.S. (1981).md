Overview:

- First paper talking about the [[concept]] of [[operative temperature]]
- The directional nature of sun and wind produces two-dimensional variations in the thermal load on the surface of an animal.
- Corresponding distributions of colour and insulation are seen on many animals.
- An [[operative temperature]] operative temperature based [[heat transfer]] model is presented for analyzing the thermoregulatory significance of such patterns.
- The sample calculations using one- and two-dimensional heat-transfer models show large differences when both insulation and thermal factors such as solar radiation vary over the surface of the animal.
