Overview:

- Quantified the effects of postural adjustments of OTMs on qualtifying on space and time availability of thermal microhabitats.
- Tested 3 differrent OTMs: tilted OTM (corresponding to an elevated lizard), unmodified OTM (corresponding to a lizard in intermediated posture) and compressed OTM (corresponding to prostrate lizard).
- 12 cm length of copper pipe (∼2.0 cm outside diameter). We used a preserved C. collaris specimen (9.8 cm SVL; University of Arkansas zoological collection) to estimate surface area variables of a mean adult sized lizard in the study population (∼9.6 cm SVL; Brewster et al., 2018) to compare to OTMs. Models were painted using spray paint  with a similar mean percent reflectance value (11.7%) as reported for C. collaris (10.6% Porter, 1967). We inserted a single iButton™ temperature data logger (Maxim Integrated Products) wrapped with a piece of aluminum screening material (to keep the iButton suspended in the center of the OTM) inside each OTM, and used a plastic plug to cover the ends of the pipe. 
- Did model valiation by first testing lizard in its ntatural habitat (got just one cloacal Tb after observing a lizard in a single position fro several mins), then putting the model there and testing the model in the same place for a few mins - NOT ROBUST!
- The benefits of using electroformed OTMs (Bakken and Gates, 1975) over cylinder shaped OTMs have been discussed in the literature (Bakken and Angilletta, 2014). In short, electroformed OTMs are designed to mimic the surface area and shape of the actual organism (Walsberg and Wolf, 1996), thus improving the odds that they will match the biophysical properties of the study animal. Nonetheless, several studies have successfully approximated Te of the target or- ganism using cylinder shaped models (i.e. Peterson et al., 1993; Diaz, 1997; Wills and Beaupre, 2000; Row and Blouin-Demers, 2006; Stanton-Jones et al., 2018).
- Conclusion: posture can play a significant role in the available space and time for surface activity in species that use this behavior; findings imply that posture can be an important component to accurately predict the impacts of changing temperatures on ectotherms that use it for behavioral thermoregulation.
